For this network, use a reasonable activation function for the hidden layers, select an appropriate loss function and optimizer, specify a validation split of 0.2, train for a reasonable number of epochs. Feel free to use tensorflow's default batch size while training. Plot the training accuracy and validation accuracy as a function of epochs from your `NN_model`'s training history. Evaluate the `NN_model` model on both train and test, and print out the resulting train and test accuracies.\n",

Some examples: if 10% of the bootstrapped models predict $\\hat{y} = 0$ with the remaining 90% predicting $\\hat{y}=1$, then the $PPD=0.1$. When a bagged prediction's $PPD=0$, all predictions are compatible (i.e. all bootstrapped probabilities for that test observation are on the same side of $\\hat{p}=0.5$). Likewise, when the $PPD=0.5$, half of the bootstrapped predictions for that test observation are $\\hat{y}=0$, and the other half are $\\hat{y}=1$. After calculating your $PPD$ values for all test observations, you should have $n=2000$ $PPD$ values (i.e. one for each test observation).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be prone to overfitting, where they learn specific patterns present in the training data, but the patterns do not generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods used to improve ANN generalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to use an architecture just barely wide or deep enough to fit the data. The idea here is that smaller networks are less expressive and thus less able to overfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is difficult to know a priori the correct size of the ANN, and it is computationally costly to hunt for the correct size. Given this, other methodologies are used to prevent overfitting and improve ANNs' generalizability. These methodologies, like other techniques that combat overfitting, fall under the umbrella term of \"regularization\".\n",
